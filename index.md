# Sunrise Quick Start Guide

The purpose of this quick start guide is to familiarize you with navigating Veeva CRM on iPad with the new Sunrise UI, including new buttons and icons. 

## Home

The Home page is where you can navigate to all the other areas of Veeva CRM on iPad. From the Tab bar at the bottom of the page, you can access Accounts, My Schedule, Events Management and more. 

Two of the most important widgets on the Home page are:

* Sync
* Update

Depending on your configuration, other widgets also display on the Home page.

### Finding Accounts - Multiple Views 

To help organize and manage your accounts, you can group them into different lists and views. Account views are defined using criteria on the four supported objects (Accounts, Addresses, TSF, and Product Metrics). These views change whenever the supporting data that matches the query is modified. 

Select Accounts in the Tab bar to display your Accounts. To display a list of your Account views, select the drop-down button [<img src="../assets/images/dropdown.png" alt="">] on the navigation bar.
